# About

This work is based on a LaTex template that was originally created
by [Adrien Friggeri](https://github.com/afriggeri/cv) and that has later been modified by [LaTeXTemplates](http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com).

It is typesetted in [Roboto](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html), a free font family developed by Google as the system font for its Android operating system. The original design of this template was typesetted in [Helvetica Neue](http://www.linotype.com/1266/neuehelvetica-family.html). This option is still present in the code if you have access to and prefer this option. The "Professional Interests" graph has been done with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is used for the icons.

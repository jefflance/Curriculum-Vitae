# About

This work is based on a LaTex template that was originally created
by [Adrien Friggeri](https://github.com/afriggeri/cv) and that has later been modified by [LaTeXTemplates](http://www.LaTeXTemplates.com).

It is typesetted in [Roboto](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html), a free font family developed by Google as the system font for its Android operating system. The option to use Helvetica Neue typeset, as per the original design of this template, is present in the code if you have access and prefer this option. The "Professional Interests" graph has been done with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/) and [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) is used for the icons.
